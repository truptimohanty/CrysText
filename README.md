# CrysText: A Generative AI Approach for Text-Conditioned Crystal Structure Generation using LLM 


The ability to generate crystal structures directly from textual descriptions marks a pivotal advancement in materials informatics and underscores the emerging role of large language models (LLMs) in inverse design. In this work, we introduce CrysText, a text-conditioned framework that generates crystal structures in Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format from natural language prompts specifying composition and space group. Leveraging LLaMA-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B-v0.3 fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), our approach enables the efficient and scalable generation of CIF-formatted structures directly from input descriptions, eliminating the need for post-processing with rapid inference. Evaluations on the MP-20 benchmark demonstrate high structural match rates and low RMSE values, confirming the modelâ€™s ability to generate physically consistent crystal structures aligned with compositional and symmetry constraints. By incorporating energy above the convex hull as a conditioning parameter, CrysText further demonstrates the ability to generate thermodynamically stable novel materials. We subsequently extend this framework with CrysText-RL, which integrates Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to provide reinforcement learning feedback directly on generated CIF outputs via group-based normalized rewards. CrysText-RL achieves additional improvements over the supervised CrysText model in terms of composition and space group satisfiability and structure match rate. This work establishes a scalable paradigm for text-driven crystal structure generation, demonstrating that both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning enable a pathway towards accelerated materials discovery.
